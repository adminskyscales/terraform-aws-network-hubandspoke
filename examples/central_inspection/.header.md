# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Inspection

This example centralizes the traffic inspection and egress traffic within the same VPC, with a central Inspection VPC with public subnets. The following resources are built:

- Built by the **Hub and Spoke module**:
  - AWS Transit Gateway.
  - AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: 1 Inspection, 2 Spokes (production and non-production).
  - Transit Gateway routes.
  - Inspection VPC - with public subnets for Internet access.
  - AWS Network Firewall (and routes in the Inspection VPC to the firewall endpoints).
- Built outside the module:
  - AWS Network Firewall policy and rule groups - check the *policy.tf* file.

## Deployment instructions

* To apply all the resources - `terraform apply`.
* Once you finish your testing remember to delete the resources to avoid having unexpected charges - `terraform destroy`.
