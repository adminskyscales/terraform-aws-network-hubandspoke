# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Inspection

In this specific example, the following resources are built:

- AWS Transit Gateway - outside of the Hub and Spoke module.
- Created by the module:
  - AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: Inspection RT (with Internet access), and Spoke RT.
  - VPCs: Inspection VPC.
  - Regarding TGW Route Tables, the Spoke RT will have a 0.0.0.0/0 route to the Inspection VPC, and the Inspection RT will be empty (waiting to have Spoke VPCs to propagate their CIDR blocks)
