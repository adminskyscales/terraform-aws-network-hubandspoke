# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Shared Services 

This example centralizes VPC endpoints with a central Shared Services VPC. The following resources are built:

- Built by the **Hub and Spoke module**:
  - AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: 1 Inspection, 3 Spokes (production, development, and testing).
  - Transit Gateway routes.
  - Shared Services VPC.
- Built outside the module:
  - AWS Transit Gateway.

## Deployment instructions

* To apply all the resources - `terraform apply`.
* Once you finish your testing remember to delete the resources to avoid having unexpected charges - `terraform destroy`.
