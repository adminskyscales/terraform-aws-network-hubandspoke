# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Shared Services and Hybrid DNS

In this specific example, the following resources are built (all of them created by the Hub and Spoke module):

- AWS Transit Gateway.
- AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: Shared Services RT, Hybrid DNS RT, Spoke RT.
- VPCs: Shared Services VPC and Hybrid DNS VPC.
- Regarding TGW Route Tables, the Spoke RT will have the propagated routes of the Shared Services and Hybrid DNS VPCs, and the Shared Services and Hybrid DNS RTs will be empty (waiting to have Spoke VPCs to propagate their CIDR blocks)
