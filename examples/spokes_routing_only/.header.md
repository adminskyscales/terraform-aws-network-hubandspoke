# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Spoke VPC routing

This example shows how to use the Hub and Spoke module to create different routing domains (Transit Gateway route tables). The VPC attachments will be propagated and associated to the corresponding route table depending the parameter *domain* declared in each VPC configuration.

- Built by the **Hub and Spoke module**:
  - AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: 1 prod, 1 nonprod.
  - Transit Gateway propagations and associations.
- Built outside the module:
  - AWS Transit Gateway.
  - 3 Amazon VPCs (2 prod, 1 nonprod) and Transit Gateway VPC attachments.

## Deployment instructions

* To apply all the resources - `terraform apply`.
* Once you finish your testing remember to delete the resources to avoid having unexpected charges - `terraform destroy`.
