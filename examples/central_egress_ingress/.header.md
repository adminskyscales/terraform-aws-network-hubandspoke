# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Egress and Ingress VPCs

In this specific example, the following resources are built (all of them created by the Hub and Spoke module):

- AWS Transit Gateway.
- AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: Egress RT, Ingress RT, Spoke RT.
- VPCs: Egress VPC (with NAT gateways) and Ingress VPC.
- Regarding TGW Route Tables, the Spoke RT will have a 0.0.0.0/0 route to the Egress VPC, and the Ingress and Egress RT will be empty (waiting to have Spoke VPCs to propagate their CIDR blocks)
