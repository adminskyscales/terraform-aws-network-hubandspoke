# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Example: Central Egress and Ingress VPCs

This example centralizes the ingress and egress traffic into an Ingress and Egress VPC respectively. The following resources are built:

- Built by the **Hub and Spoke module**:
  - AWS Transit Gateway Route Tables: 1 Ingress, 1 Egress, 1 Spokes (production).
  - Transit Gateway routes.
  - Ingress and Egress VPC.
- Built outside the module:
  - AWS Transit Gateway.
  - 2 production VPCs.
  - EC2 instances, and VPC endpoints in each Spoke VPC.
  - IAM role used for the EC2 instances to access AWS Systems Manager.

If you simply want to review the infrastructure without any workloads, remove/comment the last three modules in the *main.tf* file - remember to also remove/comment the outputs.

## Deployment instructions

* First, you need to deploy the AWS Transit Gateway, and Spoke VPCs - `terraform apply -target="module.hub-and-spoke.aws_ec2_transit_gateway.tgw" -target="module.spoke_vpcs"`.
* Once the resources are created, you can finish and apply the rest of the resources - `terraform apply`.
* Once you finish your testing remember to delete the resources to avoid having unexpected charges - `terraform destroy`.
