# AWS Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway - Terraform Module

[AWS Transit Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html) is a network hub that you can use to interconnect your VPCs and on-premises networks. With it, you can create hub and spoke architectures to control how your VPCs and on-prem resources communicate between them. In addition, you can centralize different services - like traffic inspection or the connection to VPC endpoints - and therefore avoid extra costs by overprovisioning those services.

This Terraform module helps you create the base of your networking infrastructure in AWS, by provisioning a Hub and Spoke Architecture with AWS Transit Gateway. You can indicate which resources you want to centralize - by defining which central VPCs you want to create -, and you get the Transit Gateway, VPCs, and routing needed to achieve the interconnection. The only thing you will need to do later is place your worloads and services to centralize.

## Usage

### AWS Transit Gateway

You can either define a current Transit Gateway (by passing its ID) or let the Hub and Spoke Module to create one for you. The attributes you can define when defining/creating a Transit Gateway are the following ones:

- `id` = (Optional|string) **If you specify this value, no other attributes can be set** Transit Gateway ID, that the module will use as central piece of the Hub and Spoke architecture.
- `name` = (Optional|string) Name to apply to the new Transit Gateway.
- `description` = (Optional|string) Description of the new Transit Gateway
- `amazon_side_asn` = (Optional|number) Private Autonomous System Number (ASN) for the Amazon side of a BGP session. The range is `64512` to `65534` for 16-bit ASNs and `4200000000` to `4294967294` for 32-bit ASNs. It is recommended to configure one to avoid ASN overlap. Default value: `64512`.
- `auto_accept_shared_attachments` = (Optional|string) Wheter the attachment requests are automatically accepted. Valid values: `disable` (default) or `enable`.
- `dns_support` = (Optional|string) Wheter DNS support is enabled. Valid values: `disable` or `enable` (default).
- `multicast_support` = (Optional|string) Wheter Multicas support is enabled. Valid values: `disable` (default) or `enable`.
- `transit_gateway_cidr_blocks` = (Optional|list(string)) One or more IPv4/IPv6 CIDR blocks for the Transit Gateway. Must be a size /24 for IPv4 CIDRs, and /64 for IPv6 CIDRs.
- `vpn_ecmp_support` = (Optional|string) Whever VPN ECMP support is enabled. Valid values: `disable` or `enable` (default).
- `tags` = (Optional|map(string)) Key-value tags to apply to the Transit Gateway.

### Central VPCs

The Central VPCs you can create are: `inspection`, `egress`, `ingress`, `shared_services`, and `hybrid_dns`. The Central VPCs you define have a set of input variables that are common (regardless of the type of VPC to create). These variables are inherited from the [AWS VPC Module](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-vpc), which is used to create all the VPCs in this module. The common attributes are the following ones:

- `vpc_id` = (Optional|string) **If you specify this value, no other attributes can be set** The VPC will be attached to the Transit Gateway, and its attachment associate/propagated to the corresponding TGW Route Tables.
- `name` = (Optional|string) Name of the VPC, if a new VPC is created.
- `cidr_block` = (Optional|string) CIDR range to assign to the VPC, if a new VPC is created.
- `az_count` = (Optional|number) Number of Availability Zones to use in each VPC. As best practice, we recommend the use of at least two AZs to ensure high-availability in your solutions.
- `vpc_enable_dns_hostnames` = (Optional|bool) Indicates whether the instances launched in the VPC get DNS hostnames. **Enabled by default**.
- `vpc_enable_dns_support` = (Optional|bool) Indicates whether the DNS resolution is supported for the VPC. If enabled, queries to the Amazon provided DNS server at the 169.254.169.253 IP address, or the reserved IP address at the base of the VPC network range "plus two" succeed. If disabled, the Amazon provided DNS service in the VPC that resolves public DNS hostnames to IP addresses is not enabled. **Enabled by default**.
- `vpc_instance_tenancy` = (Optional|string) The allowed tenancy of instances launched into the VPC.
- `subnet_configuration` = (Optional|any) Configuration of the subnets to create in the VPC. You can define as many subnets as you want, however, depending the type of central VPC, this definition may vary. Below you will see one example per type of Central VPC.
- `vpc_flow_logs` = = (Optional|object(any)) Configuration of the VPC Flow Logs of the VPC configured. Options: "cloudwatch", "s3", "none". The format of the object to define is the following:

```hcl
object({
    log_destination = optional(string)
    iam_role_arn    = optional(string)
    kms_key_id      = optional(string)

    log_destination_type = string
    retention_in_days    = optional(number)
    tags                 = optional(map(string))
    traffic_type         = optional(string)
    destination_options = optional(object({
      file_format                = optional(string)
      hive_compatible_partitions = optional(bool)
      per_hour_partition         = optional(bool)
    }))
  })
```

#### Inspection VPC

When defining a central Inspection VPC, you can define two types: with Internet access (inspection + egress in the same VPC) or without Internet access (if egress is configured, is placed in a different VPC). Each of the types will have a different configuration:

- **Inspection VPC with Internet access**:
 - `public`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. Additionally, it also accepts `nat_gateway_configuration`, where you can specify `all_azs` (by default), `single_az`, or `none`.
 - `endpoints`: This subnet is used to place the firewall endpoints (AWS Network Firewall or any solution with Gateway Load Balancer). You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the following routes in the subnet's route tables:
   - To the Internet (0.0.0.0/0) via the NAT gateways (if created).
   - To the Transit Gateway ENI(s). The destination passed will be the Network CIDR defined (either via a supernet or a prefix list) in the `spoke_vpcs` variable.
 - `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    inspection = {
        name = "inspection-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/16"
        az_count = 2

        subnets = {
            public = {
                netmask = 24
                nat_gateway_configuration = "all_azs"
            }
            inspection = { netmask = 24 }
            transit_gateway = { netmask = 28 }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Inspection VPC without Internet access**:
 - `endpoints`: This subnet is used to place the firewall endpoints (AWS Network Firewall or any solution with Gateway Load Balancer). You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s).
 - `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    inspection = {
        name = "inspection-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/16"
        az_count = 2

        subnets = {
            inspection = { netmask = 24 }
            transit_gateway = { netmask = 28 }
        }
    }
}
```

In addition to the subnet definition, two more attributes can be defined in the Inspection VPC:

- `inspection_flow` = (Optional|string) To indicate how the traffic should be inspected. You can define the following values: `all` (default), `east-west`, `north-south`.
- `aws_network_firewall` = (Optional|map(any)) The Hub and Spoke module also support the creation of AWS Network Firewall, using the [AWS Network Firewall module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/aws-ia/networkfirewall/aws/latest). The module will create the firewall resource and all the routing needed in the Inspection VPC, and you will need to define the following attributes:
  - `name` = (Required|string) Name of the AWS Network Firewall resource.
  - `policy_arn` = (Required|string) ARN of the AWS Network Firewall Policy resource.
  - `policy_change_protection` = (Optional|bool) To indicate whether it is possible to change the associated firewall policy after creation. Defaults to `false`.
  - `subnet_change_protection` = (Optional|bool) To indicate whether it is possible to change the associated subnet(s) after creation. Defaults to `false`.
  - `tags` = (Optional|map(string)) List of tags to apply to the AWS Network Firewall resource.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    inspection = {
        name = "inspection-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/16"
        az_count = 2
        inspection_flow = "east-west"

        aws_network_firewall = {
            name = "ANFW"
            policy_arn = aws_networkfirewall_firewall_policy.anfw_policy.arn
        }

        subnets = {
            inspection = { netmask = 24 }
            transit_gateway = { netmask = 28 }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Egress VPC

When defining a central Egress VPC, the following subnet configuration is expected:

- `public`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. Additionally, it also accepts `nat_gateway_configuration`, where you can specify `all_azs` (by default), `single_az`, or `none`. By default, it creates the a route to the Transit Gateway ENI(s), using as destination the Network CIDR defined (either via a supernet or a prefix list) in the `spoke_vpcs` variable.
- `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module. Additionally, it creates a route to the Internet (0.0.0.0/0) via the NAT gateways (if created).

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    egress = {
        name = "egress-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
        az_count = 2

        vpc_flow_logs = {
            iam_role_arn = "ROLEARN" # You should add here an IAM role so VPC Flow logs can publish in CloudWatch Logs
            kms_key_id = "KMSARN" # You should add here a KMS Key ARN to encrypt the logs at rest (best practice)

            log_destination_type = "cloudwatch"
            retention_in_days = 7
        }

        subnets = {
            public = {
                name_prefix = "public_egress"
                cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/28", "10.10.0.16/28"]
                nat_gateway_configuration = "all_azs"
            }
            transit_gateway = {
                name_prefixt = "tgw_egress"
                cidrs = ["10.10.0.32/28", "10.10.0.48/28"]
            }
        }
}
```

**NOTE** Both Inspection VPC with public subnets and Egress VPC cannot be created at the same time.

#### Shared Services VPC

When defining a central Shared Services VPC, three subnet types are expected: `endpoints` (to place VPC Interface endpoints), `dns` (to place Route 53 Resolver endpoints, or your own DNS solution in AWS), and `transit_gateway`. Two types of VPC can be created: with DNS subnets, and without DNS subnets.

- **Shared Services VPC with only "endpoints" subnets**:
 - `endpoints`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s).
 - `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    shared_services = {
        name = "shared-services-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
        az_count = 2

        subnets = {
            endpoints = { netmask = 28 }
            transit_gateway = { netmask = 28 }
        }
    }
}
```

- **Shared Services VPC with "endpoints" and "dns" subnets**:
 - `endpoints`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s).
 - `dns`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s).
 - `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    shared_services = {
        name = "shared-services-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
        az_count = 2

        subnets = {
            endpoints = { netmask = 28 }
            dns = { netmask = 28 }
            transit_gateway = { netmask = 28 }
        }
    }
}
```

**NOTE** Both Shared Services VPC with "dns" subnets and Hybrid DNS VPC cannot be created at the same time.

#### Hybrid DNS VPC

When defining a central Hybrid DNS VPC, the following subnet configuration is expected:

- `endpoints`: To place Route 53 Resolver endpoints, or your own DNS solution in AWS. You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a default route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s).
- `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    hybrid_dns = {
        name = "hybrid-dns-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
        az_count = 2

        vpc_flow_logs = {
            iam_role_arn = "ROLEARN" # You should add here an IAM role so VPC Flow logs can publish in CloudWatch Logs
            kms_key_id = "KMSARN" # You should add here a KMS Key ARN to encrypt the logs at rest (best practice)

            log_destination_type = "cloudwatch"
            retention_in_days = 7
        }

        subnets = {
            endpoints = {
                name_prefix = "r53_endpoints"
                cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/28", "10.10.0.16/28"]
            }
            transit_gateway = {
                name_prefixt = "tgw"
                cidrs = ["10.10.0.32/28", "10.10.0.48/28"]
            }
        }
}
```

#### Ingress VPC

When defining a central Ingress VPC, the following subnet configuration is expected:

- `public`: To place your entry point to AWS from the Internet (Elastic Load Balancer, for example). You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. By default, it creates the a route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Transit Gateway ENI(s), using as destination the Network CIDR defined (either via a supernet or a prefix list) in the `spoke_vpcs` variable.
- `transit_gateway`: You can define the following attributes: `cidrs`, `netmask`, `name_prefix`, `tags`. The rest of the variables needed to create the Transit Gateway VPC attachment are handled by the module.

```hcl
central_vpcs = {

    ingress = {
        name = "ingress-vpc"
        cidr_block = "10.10.0.0/24"
        az_count = 2

        vpc_flow_logs = {
            iam_role_arn = "ROLEARN" # You should add here an IAM role so VPC Flow logs can publish in CloudWatch Logs
            kms_key_id = "KMSARN" # You should add here a KMS Key ARN to encrypt the logs at rest (best practice)

            log_destination_type = "cloudwatch"
            retention_in_days = 7
        }

        subnets = {
            public = { cidrs = ["10.10.0.0/28", "10.10.0.16/28"] }
            transit_gateway = { cidrs = ["10.10.0.32/28", "10.10.0.48/28"] }
        }
}
```
